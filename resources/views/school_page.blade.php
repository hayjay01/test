					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-5p">mission Statement :</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-11 m-t-10">Our mission is to promote lifelong learning in an open and caring atmosphere that motivates students to be confident and responsible global citizens.</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-2p">Our vision :</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-11 m-t-10">To lead holistic, inclusive, innovative world class education in Africa.</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-2p">Our aim :</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-11 m-t-10">Our aim is to lay the foundation of a life-long educational experience, which will give the individual confidence and respect that will overcome all distinctions of race, class, colour and creed. We also wish to develop in our students a consciousness of the needs of society and the desire to contribute positively through selfless service, putting the totality of God-given talents and acquired knowledge to the service of humanity.</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-2p">Our core Values :</p>

					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-2p">Our Philosophy:</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-11 m-t-10">The school is non-partisan, non-denominational and non-discriminatory. The only criteria for admission are academic merit and the willingness to do one's best to achieve excellence.<br>
					We believe that all African children in schools are members of a privileged minority, regardless of social and economic standing, and we owe them a duty to provide the highest possible standard of education.<br>The school's philosophy embraces internationalism in its widest sense. Education is a global phenomenon; as such, we seek excellence wherever it is to be found and use it to raise our standards.</p>

					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-14 p-t-2p">Why choose Greensprings?</p>
					<p class="c-greyish-brown f-11 m-t-10">In Pre-School the Montessori Method ensures that pupils become confident and independent learners who are adequately prepared for our Elementary School.<br>

					In Elementary School we encourage our pupils to develop an enquiring mind, to be self-managers, employing cross-curricular methods of learning through the British National Curriculum.<br>

					In Secondary School our students strive for excellence, acquire ethical values and develop skills to help them achieve their future goals at home and abroad, and finally write the Cambridge IGCSE Exam.<br>

					At International Baccalaureate level students learn to harness their interests, hone their talents to become agents of change on the national and international stage. (Lekki campus)<br>

					In the Pastoral Centre (Lekki campus) students of all ages learn to work co-operatively and independently as part of a family community as they enjoy a wide range of excellent facilities.<br>

					All students will be empowered to discover and develop their skills and talents, positioning them to function as well-rounded citizens.</p>
